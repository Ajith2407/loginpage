  THE KAIZEN VOIZ <br>
    Kaizen Voiz was set up with the foundational idea of 
    making digital identity authentication simple, seamless,
     and secure. Our vision is to make voice the identity of users 
     around the globe and empower them with access to digital domains
      irrespective of language, device, or literacy.

     
      <br>
      “Kaizen Secure Voiz” is a Voice Biometric Authentication & 
      Verification tool, that does away with the need for people
     
       to remember password or PIN etc.

       <br>
       <br>
       CHALLENGES TO AUTHENICATION<br>
       
Accurate verification and authentication are a necessity in a
digital world. Lack of access to special equipment, complexity, 
language, inability to travel, and digital illiteracy keeps a
sizeable portion of users stuck with pin and password-based systems.
 It is time for change with voice biometrics.

 verification technology.
