Accurate verification and authentication are a necessity in a <br>
digital world. Lack of access to special equipment, complexity, <br>
language, inability to travel, and digital illiteracy keeps a <br>
sizeable portion of users stuck with pin and password-based systems.<br>
 It is time for change with voice biometrics.<br>
